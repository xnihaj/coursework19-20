        Development
      </h2>
      <p>
        Since 1985, a red LED eyepiece display technology called Scanned Linear
        Array was developed by Massachusetts-based Reflection Technology, Inc.
        (RTI).[2][3] The company produced a "3D" stereoscopic head-tracking
        prototype called the Private Eye, featuring a tank game. Seeking funding
        and partnerships by which to develop it into a commercial technology,
        RTI demonstrated Private Eye to the consumer electronics market,
        including Mattel and Hasbro.[3] Sega declined the technology, due to its
        single-color display and concerns about motion sickness.[3][4]
      </p>
      <p>
        Nintendo enthusiastically received the Private Eye, as led by Gunpei
        Yokoi, the general manager of Nintendo's R&D1 and the inventor of the
        Game & Watch and Game Boy handheld consoles. He saw this as a unique
        technology that competitors would find difficult to emulate.
        Additionally, the resulting game console was intended to enhance
        Nintendo's reputation as an innovator[3][5] and to "encourage more
        creativity" in games.[6]:514 Codenaming the project "VR32",[3] Nintendo
        entered into an exclusive agreement with Reflection Technology, Inc. to
        license the technology for its displays.[2] While Nintendo's Research &
        Development 3 division (R&D3) was focused on developing the Nintendo 64,
        the other two engineering units were free to experiment with new product
        ideas.[5]
      </p>
      <p>
        Spending four years in development and eventually building a dedicated
        manufacturing plant in China,[3] Nintendo worked to turn its VR32 vision
        into an affordable and health-conscious console design.[5] Yokoi
        retained RTI's choice of red LED because it was the cheapest,[5] and
        because unlike a backlit LCD, its perfect blackness could achieve a more
        immersive sense of infinite depth.[3] RTI and Nintendo said a color LCD
        system would have been prohibitively expensive,[3][7] retailing for more
        than US$500.[6]:514 A color LCD system was also said to have caused
        "jumpy images in tests".[7] With ongoing concerns about motion sickness,
        the risk of developing lazy eye conditions in young children, and
        Japan's new Product Liability Act of 1995, Nintendo eliminated the head
        tracking functionality and converted its headmounted goggle design into
        a stationary, heavy, precision steel-shielded, tabletop form factor
        conformant to the recommendation of the Schepens Eye Research
        Institute.[3][6]:514
